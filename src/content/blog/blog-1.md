Hello (annyeong haseyo), my name is Anza and I was encouraged to start this blog to share my journey with others. I am not much of a writer in any way but a remarkably close relative who has been my backbone for the past 11 years and my biggest supporter has somehow persuaded me to start this blog.
<br />
<br />

I am sure everyone who has travelled to different countries or continent has a blog about their experience. I’m not sure what my blog can offer. I’m unsure if anyone besides myself and some family and friends will ever read this. I wanted to capture my experience and if it brings you joy as you read or peaks your interest or just encourages you to take a step forward that you never imagined, well…then it was very much worthwhile writing about my experience.
<br />
<br />
I am in my late 40s and I have two kids that are now young adults. I have recently exited a 22-year relationship and have been at a loss in regards to what to do with my life. When my kids were younger, they were a huge part of my day, school, after school activities, etc but now they are young adults, they are living their own lives and I am not needed as much. At the same time this occurred, I decided my current occupation was not the field I wanted to remain in for my career.

I struggled what to do, where to go, what is next. There were no obvious sign posts telling me go this way or do this thing. So, with some help, I started to imagine what future I wanted now. What shape I wanted my life to take and how I could best achieve that goal. I tried (this was really hard) to imagine no restrictions and let my heart lead the way.
<br />
<br />
I’ll always be there for my kids, my family and friends. At some point though, we have to life this one life we have for ourselves.
I am sure some readers have dedicated their time and energy into a relationship, to kids or a career but still felt like something is missing!
Have you ever wondered or asked yourself "what if" and then feel that you might not deserve to daydream or ask the “what if” question?
Do you feel like you are left behind or trapped?
<br />
<br />
Well I have news for you that you can dream big, that you can ask “what if” and then decide to do something completely different if that’s what you need. Yes it’s scary and yes you will second guess yourself often.
<br />
<br />
I have felt unaccomplished and under supported for much of my life. Now that life was looking so different from what I had expected at this point in my life, I decide to make a big change. That change was to move out of Canada and go and experience life!
